At the age of three, he fashioned his first pair of skis out of thin, flexible chestnut slats from an orange crate. Much to his mother’s dismay, he nailed his good house shoes to these skis, and he was off. Klaus made his way to the United States in 1947 and became a ski school instructor in Aspen, Colorado. It was this job that led to the founding of Sport Obermeyer. At 102, with a beautiful family, staggering list of product innovations, and numerous industry awards bearing his name, Klaus still resides at his ranch on the Roaring Fork River. He comes to work seven days a week, swims a half mile each day, skis all winter, plays tennis, practices Akido, and has a smile and hello for everyone he meets.<br\/><br\/>These incredible memories and milestones make Klaus not just the fearless founder and president of Obermeyer, but the true heart of the company. His contagious enthusiasm and boundless optimism inspires family and friends, the employees he works with every day, and countless fans worldwide. They all say Klaus inspires them to try new things, think big, get outside, and live a well-balanced life. They strive not only to “ski like Klaus,” (a popular bumper sticker seen around Aspen) but to “be like Klaus.”<\/p>","textcolor":"#ffffff","fontsize-copy":14,"fontsize-copy-mobile":14,"buttons":false,"butt-bgcolor":"#000000","butt-textcolor":"#ffffff","cta1_text":"","cta1_link":"","cta2_text":"","cta2_link":"","hover_button_text":"Explore MTB armor","image_link":""}},"b5f158e6-ea74-4903-8642-a7c9456fe420":{"type":"fullimage","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/BeLikeKlaus.jpg","mbsize":125,"image_link":"","show_text_below":true,"copyoverlay":false,"overlay":10,"text_align":"left","vertical":"center","horizontal":"center","padding-copy":0,"padding-copyh":0,"heading":"","headcolor":"#ffffff","fontsize":30,"fontsize-mobile":30,"text":"","textcolor":"#ffffff","fontsize-copy":14,"fontsize-copy-mobile":14,"cta1_text":"","cta1_link":"","button_type_1":"secondary","cta2_text":"","cta2_link":"","button_type_2":"secondary","padding-top":0,"padding-right":0,"padding-bottom":0,"padding-left":0}}},"block_order":["8aed292a-0471-41c5-9a11-509cad01f226","b5f158e6-ea74-4903-8642-a7c9456fe420"],"settings":{"fullwidth":true,"bgcolor":"#ffffff","gridspace":0,"height":50,"margin-top":0,"margin-bottom":0,"padding-top":0,"padding-bottom":0,"margin-top-mobile":0,"margin-bottom-mobile":0,"padding-top-mobile":0,"padding-bottom-mobile":0}},"header":{"type":"main-banner","disabled":true,"settings":{"color_scheme":"background-1","padding-vertical":80,"padding-horizontal":40}}},"order":["16645631263a4343cf","1664562240a45a7806","16645623404ef094a6","1662011025a73b01f7","1662015492c499d3ed","166258754225a4a17a","1662588297b52ce97c","1662588599b09e060a","16625896114fd22579","16625898614fca8f18","16625900376e88963e","header"]}
